INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
NEEDED

Upload these files to your website  (I suggest uploading the entire zip file then unpacking on your website) then
navigate to install.php and fill out the forms once you have done that a link to the admin creation page will appear
create a new admin account and you will be ready to use it. Its that simple.
